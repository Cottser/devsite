# devsite

Quickly set up a local copy of a Drupal site.

This script is very opinionated and geared towards a set of conventions, and is
also in very early development so there will be more documentation to come.

## Optional dependencies

This becomes a lot more useful with [virtualhost.sh](https://github.com/virtualhost/virtualhost.sh),
installable via Homebrew:

    brew install virtualhost.sh
