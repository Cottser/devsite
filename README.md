# devsite

Quickly set up a local copy of a Drupal site.

This script is very opinionated and geared towards a set of conventions, and is
also in very early development so there will be more documentation to come.

## Optional dependencies

This becomes a lot more useful with [virtualhost.sh](https://github.com/pgib/virtualhost.sh),
installable via Homebrew:

    brew install virtualhost.sh

If you sometimes have an extra level of nesting within your DocumentRoot (for
example a `docroot` folder), then keep an eye on [this virtualhost.sh issue](https://github.com/pgib/virtualhost.sh/pull/53)
or install [my fork](https://github.com/Cottser/virtualhost.sh).
